## Core React


    
1. ### What is React?

    React is an **open-source front-end JavaScript library** that is used for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. React was created by [Jordan Walke](https://github.com/jordwalke), a software engineer working for Facebook. React was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012.

2. ### What are the major features of React?

    The major features of React are:

    * It uses **VirtualDOM** instead of RealDOM considering that RealDOM manipulations are expensive.
    * Supports **server-side rendering**.
    * Follows **Unidirectional** data flow or data binding.
    * Uses **reusable/composable** UI components to develop the view.

3. ### What is JSX?

    *JSX* is a XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript (the acronym stands for *JavaScript XML*). Basically it just provides syntactic sugar for the `React.createElement()` function, giving us expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax.

    In the example below text inside `<h1>` tag is returned as JavaScript function to the render function.

    ```jsx harmony
    class App extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return(
          <div>
            <h1>{'Welcome to React world!'}</h1>
          </div>
        )
      }
    }
    ```

4. ### What is the difference between Element and Component?

    An *Element* is a plain object describing what you want to appear on the screen in terms of the DOM nodes or other components. *Elements* can contain other *Elements* in their props. Creating a React element is cheap. Once an element is created, it is never mutated.

    The object representation of React Element would be as follows:

    ```javascript
    const element = React.createElement(
      'div',
      {id: 'login-btn'},
      'Login'
    )
    ```

    The above `React.createElement()` function returns an object:

    ```
    {
      type: 'div',
      props: {
        children: 'Login',
        id: 'login-btn'
      }
    }
    ```

    And finally it renders to the DOM using `ReactDOM.render()`:

    ```html
    <div id='login-btn'>Login</div>
    ```

    Whereas a **component** can be declared in several different ways. It can be a class with a `render()` method or it can be defined as a function. In either case, it takes props as an input, and returns a JSX tree as the output:

    ```javascript
    const Button = ({ onLogin }) =>
      <div id={'login-btn'} onClick={onLogin}>Login</div>
    ```

    Then JSX gets transpiled to a `React.createElement()` function tree:

    ```javascript
    const Button = ({ onLogin }) => React.createElement(
      'div',
      { id: 'login-btn', onClick: onLogin },
      'Login'
    )
    ```

5. ### How to create components in React?

    There are two possible ways to create a component.

    1. **Function Components:** This is the simplest way to create a component. Those are pure JavaScript functions that accept props object as the first parameter and return React elements:

        ```jsx harmony
        function Greeting({ message }) {
          return <h1>{`Hello, ${message}`}</h1>

        }
        ```

    2. **Class Components:** You can also use ES6 class to define a component. The above function component can be written as:

        ```jsx harmony
        class Greeting extends React.Component {
          render() {
            return <h1>{`Hello, ${this.props.message}`}</h1>
          }
        }
        ```
